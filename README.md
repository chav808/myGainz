## What is myGainz?

myGainz is a senior level Software Engineering project implementing a modern web-based application via a FERN stack. It is centered around the importance of fitness, health, exercise and diet.
FERN is an acronym for **F**irebase, **E**xpress, **R**eact, **N**ode, the set of technologies required to use this application.

## The File Structure

Looks like this inside the repo folder:

```bash

|--server--config            <- Put firebase config here
|
|--client--src-----config    <- Put firebase config here
|	|
|	------components <- Put webpages here
|	|
|	-------assets    <- Put media (photos, logos, videos, etc.)


Inside ~/client/src directory, we are putting these files:

	- app.js
	- index.js
	- app.css
	- index.css

```
